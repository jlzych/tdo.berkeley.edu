    <h3>1.3.3 Why is it Being Organized?</h3>

    <p class = "quoted"> "The central purpose of systems for organizing information [is] bringing like things together and differentiating among them" (Svenonius, 2000 p. xi). </p>

    <p>Almost by definition, the essential purpose of any Organizing System is to describe or arrange resources so they can be located and accessed later.  The organizing principles needed to achieve this goal depend on the types of resources or domains being organized, and in the personal, social, or institutional setting in which organization takes place.  "Bringing like things together" is an informal organizing principle for many Organizing Systems.  But there will likely be a number of more precise requirements or constraints to satisfy. </p>

    <p>Organizing Systems involving physical resources are more likely to emphasize aesthetic or emotional goals than those for information resources, which more often are dominated by functional goals like efficiency of storage and access. This contrast is often magnified by the tendency for major library and museum collections to be housed in buildings designed as architectural monuments that over time become symbols of national or cultural identity. </p>

    <p>The fine distinctions between Organizing Systems that have many characteristics in common reflect subtle differences in the priority of their shared goals. For example, many Organizing Systems create collections and enable interactions with the goals of supporting scientific research, public education, and entertainment. We can contrast zoos, animal theme parks, and wild animal preserves in terms of the absolute and relative importance of these three goals. </p>

    <p>When individuals manage their papers, books, documents, record albums, compact discs, DVDs, and other information resources, their Organizing Systems vary greatly. This is in part because the content of the resources being organized becomes a consideration. Furthermore, many of the Organizing Systems used by individuals are implemented by web applications, and this makes them more accessible because their resources can be accessed from anywhere with a web browser.<span class = "typeless"> For example, many people manage their digital photos with Flickr, their home libraries with LibraryThing, and their preferences for dining and shopping with Yelp. It is possible to use these "tagging" sites solely in support of individual goals, as tags like "myfamily," "toread," or "buythis" clearly demonstrate. But maintaining a personal Organizing System with these web applications potentially augments the individual's purpose with social goals like conveying information to others, developing a community, or promoting a reputation.  Furthermore, because these community or collaborative applications aggregate and share the tags applied by individuals, they shape the individual Organizing Systems embedded within them when they suggest the most frequent tags for a particular resource.</span></p> 

    <p>Put another way, an information resource inherently has more potential uses than resources like forks or frying pans, so it isn't surprising that the Organizing Systems in offices are even more diverse than those in kitchens.  </p>

    <p>When the scale of the collection or the number of intended users increases, not everyone is likely to share the same goals and design preferences for the Organizing System. If you share a kitchen with housemates, you might have to negotiate and compromise on some of the decisions about how the kitchen is organized so you can all get along.  In more formal or institutional Organizing Systems conflicts between stakeholders can be much more severe, and the organizing principles might even be specified in commercial contracts or governed by law.  For example, Bowker and Star note that physicians view the creation of patient records as central to diagnosis and treatment, insurance companies think of them as evidence needed for payment and reimbursement, and researchers think of them as primary data.  Not surprisingly, policymaking and regulations about patient records are highly contentious.<span class = "citation"> Bowker and Star, Sorting Things Out: Classification and Its Consequences…</span></p>

    <p>We can look back to the invention of mechanized printing in the fifteenth century, which radically increased the number of books and periodicals, as the motivation for libraries to develop systematic methods for cataloging and classifying what they owned and to view themselves as doing more than just preserving a collection.  Libraries began progressively more refined efforts to state the functional requirements for their Organizing Systems and to be explicit about how they met those requirements. </p>

    <p>Today, the Organizing Systems in a large academic research library must also support many functions and services other than those that directly support search and location of resources in their collections.  In these respects, the Organizing Systems in non-profit libraries have much in common with those in corporate information repositories and business applications. See the Sidebar, "Library {and, or, vs.} Business Organizing Systems."</p>

    <div class = "sidebar_div">
      <h4>LIBRARY {AND, OR, VS.} BUSINESS ORGANIZING SYSTEMS</h4>

      <p class="sidebar">Any information-driven enterprise must have processes and technologies in place that govern information creation or capture and then manage its entire life cycle. In addition to the Organizing Systems that manage and provide access to their collections, large libraries also need business Organizing Systems to support acquisition, billing, interlibrary loan record routing and systems, licenses of digital resources from publishers, course material websites, and the library's own web presence. Commercial firms need processes for transacting with customers or other firms to carry out business operations, to support research and innovation, and to develop business strategy and tactics in compliance with laws and regulations for accounting, taxes, human resources, data retention, and so on. In large firms these functions are so highly specialized and complex that the different types of Organizing Systems have distinct names: Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Enterprise Content Management (ECM), Supply Chain Management, Records Management, Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Business Intelligence (BI), Knowledge Management, and so on. And even though the most important functions in the Organizing Systems of large enterprises are those that manage the information resources needed for its business operation, these firms might also need to maintain corporate libraries and archives. </p>
    </div>

    <p>Preserving documents in their physical or original form is the primary purpose of archives and similar Organizing Systems that contain culturally, historically, or economically significant documents that have value as long-term evidence. Preservation is also an important motivation for the Organizing Systems of information- and knowledge-intensive firms. Businesses and governmental agencies are usually required by law to keep records of financial transactions, decision-making, personnel matters, and other information essential to business continuity, compliance with regulations and legal procedures, and transparency.  As with archives, it is sometimes critical that these business knowledge or records management systems can retrieve the original documents, although digital copies that can be authenticated are increasingly being accepted as legally equivalent. </p>

    <p>Chapter 6, "Classification," more fully explains the different purposes for Organizing Systems, the organizing principles they embody, and the methods for assigning items to classifications.  </p>

    <h3>1.3.4 How Much is it Being Organized</h3>

    <p class = "quoted">"It is a general bibliographic truth that not all documents should be accorded the same degree of organization" (Svenonius, 2000 p. 24).</p>

    <p>Not all resources should be accorded the same degree of organization.  In this section we will briefly unpack this notion of degree of organization into its two more important and related dimensions: the amount of description or organization applied to each resource and the amount of organization of resources into classes or categories.  Chapter 4, "Describing Resources," Chapter 5, "Categories," and Chapter 7, "Implementing Resource Descriptions," more thoroughly address these questions about the nature and extent of description in Organizing Systems.<p>

    <p>Not all resources in a collection require the same degree of description for the simple reason we discussed in Section 1.3.3: Organizing Systems exist for different purposes and to support different kinds of interactions or functions.  Let's contrast two ends of the "degree of description" continuum.  Many people use "current events awareness" or "news feed" applications that select news stories whose titles or abstracts contain one or more keywords.  This exact match algorithm is easy to implement, but its all-or-none and one-item-at-a-time comparison misses any stories that use synonyms of the keyword, that are written in languages different from that of the keyword, or that are otherwise relevant but don't contain the exact keyword in the limited part of the document that is scanned.  However, users with current events awareness goals don't need to see every news story about some event, and this limited amount of description for each story and the simple method of comparing descriptions are sufficient.  </p>

    <p>On the other hand, this simple Organizing System is inadequate for the purpose of comprehensive retrieval of all documents that relate to some concept, event, or problem.  This is a critical task for scholars, scientists, inventors, physicians, attorneys and similar professionals who might need to discover every relevant document in some domain. Instead, this type of Organizing System needs rich bibliographic and semantic description of each document, most likely assigned by professional cataloguers, and probably using terms from a controlled vocabulary to enforce consistency in what descriptions mean.  </p>

    <p>Similarly, different merchants or firms might make different decisions about the extent or granularity of description when they assign SKUs because of differences in suppliers, targeted customers, or other business strategies. If you take your car to the repair shop because windshield wiper fluid is leaking, you might be dismayed to find that the broken rubber seal that is causing the leak can't be ordered separately and you have to pay to replace the "wiper fluid reservoir" for which the seal is a minor but vital part. Likewise, when two business applications try to exchange and merge customer information, integration problems will arise if one describes a customer as a single "NAME" component while the other separates the customer's name into "TITLE", "FIRSTNAME," and "LASTNAME."  </p>

    <p>Even when faced with the same collection of resources, people differ in how much organization they prefer or how much disorganization they can tolerate. A classic study by Tom Malone of how people organize their office workspaces and desks contrasted the strategies and methods of "filers" and "pilers." Filers maintain clean desktops and systematically organize their papers into categories, while pilers have messy work areas and make few attempts at organization. This contrast has analogues in other organizing systems and we can easily imagine what happens if a "neat freak" and "slob" become roommates.<span class="citation"> Malone study and many of those it inspired; see also Myth of Paperless Office., Kirsh work on office anthropology, Neil Simon "Odd Couple"</span></p>

    <p>Different preferences and disagreements between stakeholders in an Organizing System about how much organization is necessary often result because of the implications for who does the work and who gets the benefits. Physicians prefer narrative descriptions and broad classification systems because they make it easier to create patient notes.  In contrast, insurance companies and researchers want fine-grained "form-filling" descriptions and detailed classifications that would make the physician's work more onerous.<span class="citation"> Grudin CSCW classic paper etc.</span></p>

    <p>The cost-effectiveness of creating systematic and comprehensive descriptions of the resources in an information collection has been debated for nearly two centuries and in the last half century the scope of the debate grew to consider the role of computer-generated resource descriptions.<span class="LIS"> Sir Anthony Panizzi is most often associated with the origins of modern library cataloging. In 1841 (Panizzi, 1841) published 91 cataloging rules for the British Library that defined authoritative forms for titles and author names, but the complexity of the rules and the resulting resource descriptions were widely criticized. For example, the famous author and historian Thomas Carlyle argued that a library catalog should be nothing more than a list of the names of the books in it.  Standards for bibliographic description are essential if resources are to be shared between libraries.  </span></p> 

    <p>An alternative and complement to man-made descriptions for each resource are computer-generated indexes of their textual contents. These indexes typically assign weights to the terms according to calculations that consider the frequency and distribution of the terms in both individual documents and in the collection as a whole to create a description of what the documents are about. These descriptions of the documents in the collection are more consistent than those created by human organizers. They allow for more complex query processing and comparison operations by the retrieval functions in the Organizing System.  For example, query expansion mechanisms or thesauri can automatically add synonyms and related terms to the search. Additionally, retrieved documents can be arranged by relevance, while "citing" and "cited-by" links can be analyzed to find related relevant documents. </p>

    <p>A second constraint on the degree of organization comes from the absolute size of the collection within the scope of the Organizing System. Organizing more resources requires more descriptions to distinguish any particular resource from the rest and more constraining organizing principles. Similar resources need to be grouped or classified to emphasize the most important distinctions among the complete set of resources in the collection.  A small neighborhood restaurant might have a short wine list with just ten wines, arranged in two categories for "red" and "white" and described only by the wine's name and price. In contrast, a gourmet restaurant might have hundreds of wines in its wine list, which would subdivide its "red" and "white" high-level categories into subcategories for country, region of origin, and grape varietal. The description for each wine might in addition include a specific vineyard from which the grapes were sourced, the vintage year, ratings of the wine, and tasting notes.</p>

    <p>At some point a collection grows so large that it is not economically feasible for people to create bibliographic descriptions or to classify each separate resource.<span class="typeless"> Unless there are so many users of the collection that their aggregated effort is comparably large; this is organizing by “crowdsourcing” (See the Sidebar on “Web 2.0” in Section 1.3.6).</span> This leaves two approaches that can be done separately or in tandem. The simpler approach is to describe sets of resources or documents as a set or group, which is especially sensible for archives with its emphasis on the fonds (see Section 1.3.2). The second approach is to rely on automated and more general-purpose organizing technologies that organize resources through computational means. Search engines are familiar examples of computational organizing technology, and section 6.5, "Computational Classification," describes other common techniques in machine learning, clustering, and discriminant analysis that can be used to create a system of categories and to assign resources to them. </p>

    <p>Chapter 8, "Implementing Resource Descriptions," focuses on the representation and management of descriptions, taking a more technological or implementation perspective.  Chapter 9, "Interactions in Organizing Systems," discusses how the nature and extent of descriptions determines the capabilities of the interactions that locate, compare, combine, or otherwise use resources in information-intensive domains.</p>
